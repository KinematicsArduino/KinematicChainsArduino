# KinematicChainsArduino

The KinematicChainsArduino project is an extension of LLAMA-Q, a project aimed at facilitating the generalization of Robot control to lower the barrier of entry to, and . 

This library enables and abstract complex robot control on Arduino. Any Robot can be defined with few lines of code.

With this Library one can 
    - Define a Kinematic Chain
    
    - Define Robot Kinematics by FK, IK with an option to define the Jacobian or Inverse Jacobian
    
    - Define Robot actuators and hardware 
    
    - Define a Robot using Robot actuators and Robot Kinematics
    
    - Control a defined robots position with non-blocking functions.
